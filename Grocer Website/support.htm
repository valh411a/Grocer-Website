        <div class="content">
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure your device is compatible with the app by visiting the <a href="https://play.google.com/"
                        target="_blank"> Google Play Store page</a> for the
                    app. If your device is incompatible with the app, there will be a red dialog box where
                    the install button should be located.</li>
                <li>If your device is compatible, then your next step (should the app still be
                    unable to be started) is to visit the <a href="contactus.htm">Contact us</a> page so
                    that we can assist you directly with solving the issue.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>To prevent this from happening to you, please remember to regularly back up
                    your user data from the settings periodically! The app will auto-save all changes made
                    to your data frequently, but this method may be vulnerable to issues such as unexpected
                    device shutdown or removal of the storage device for the app.</li>
                <li>if you are missing any data that was entered recently, this may have been due
                    to a sudden interruption of the app while user data was being saved.</li>
                <li>If all of your saved items, lists, stores, etc. are missing, first open the
                    settings and make sure you did not previously reset the app from the settings. You will
                    know that this was done when a red section is displayed at the top that contains the
                    words "App has recently been reset, all user-related items have been removed." </li>
                <li>If the dialog is not displayed (it will remain for up to 48 hours after a
                    reset), then attempt to restart the app by closing and re-opening the app. </li>
                <li>If all of your data is still missing after restarting the app, then please
                    visit the <a href="contactus.htm">Contact us</a> page so that we can assist you directly
                    with solving the issue.</li>

                <li>The barcode scanner requires permission from you in order to use the camera on
                    your device.</li>
                <li>When starting the barcode scanner for the first time, you will receive a
                    dialog requesting permission to access the camera on your device.</li>
                <li>Clicking 'allow' will permit usage for the barcode capturing service. Clicking
                    'deny' will bring you to the issue described above.</li>
                <li>To correct the issue, visit the settings app on your device and reset the
                    permissions for this app.</li>
                <li>If the issue persists, please verify that the camera for your device is
                    operable.</li>
