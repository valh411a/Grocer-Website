<!--Assignment notes for Mrs.Ferner: I took the professional approach to webpage design and decided to make the index page a seperate one from the home page. Both pages are reachable from one another, but each has their own unique function. This home page functions as the landing page for the site that fulfils the normal function for a typical website's homepage.-->
