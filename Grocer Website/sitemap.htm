<!--Assignment notes for Mrs.Ferner: I took the professional approach to webpage design and decided to make the index page a seperate one from the home page. Both pages are reachable from one another, but each has their own unique function. This index page functions as an index of the site pages for developer and crawling access to directly reach a specific page and subvert site navigation.-->
